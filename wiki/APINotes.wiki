= Introduction =

I've been using the AlivePDF library for a few days now and have some observations that might help others just starting off.  I invite others to post what you've found here as well.


= Saving to a file in an AIR application =
{{{
public class ProjectPDFExporter
{
private var filename:String = “test.pdf”;
private var pdf:PDF;

 public function exportPdf(filename:String) : void
 {
  this.filename = filename;

  pdf = new PDF();

  pdf.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onComplete);

  pdf.setDisplayMode (Display.FULL_PAGE,
  Layout.SINGLE_PAGE);

  pdf.addPage();
  pdf.setFont( FontFamily.ARIAL );
  pdf.addText(”My Teax”,1,10);
  pdf.setFont( FontFamily.ARIAL , “”, 32);
  pdf.addText(”Some more text”,10,30);
  pdf.finish();
 }

 protected function onComplete(event:Event)
 {
  var f:FileStream = new FileStream();
  var file:File =
  File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolve( filename );
  f.open( file, FileMode.WRITE);
  var bytes:ByteArray = pdf.getPDF()
  f.writeBytes(bytes);
  f.close();
 }
}
}}}
